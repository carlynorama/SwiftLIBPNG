- <http://www.libpng.org>
- <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/book/>
- more up to date than /book -> <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng-manual.txt> 
- had information that I did not find in manual. Actually has code post v1.6 -><https://github.com/glennrp/libpng/blob/12222e6fbdc90523be77633ed430144cfee22772/INSTALL> 


For information on how this library was made and other "how to get it to compile" info see [META.md](META.md)

So far, it compiles fine for MacOS 13+ (Swift 5.7, Xcode 14) using both Intel and M1 hardware with `libpng` installed via homebrew.
